Now a days Mobile is one of the most selling and purchasing device. Every day new mobiles with new version and more features are launched. Thousands of mobiles are sold and purchased on daily basis.

Therefore, Price estimation and prediction is an important part of consumer strategy as a new product that has to be launched, must have the correct price so that the consumers find it appropriate to buy the product. During the purchase of mobile phones, people fail to make correct decisions due to the non-availability of necessary resources to cross validate the price. To address this issue, we developed different classification models using the data related to different features of a mobile phone. The developed model is then used to predict the price range of the new mobile phones.

The main objective of this work is to find out the relationship between features of a mobile phone and its price range which indicates whether the mobile would be cheap(0), mid-range(1), expensive(2) or very expensive(3). We will be using different classification models to accurately classify the data in correct price ranges.

Based on our dataset, Data prepressing was the first step followed. After that i am going to do Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization in which we are finding some insights from the data and relations between the features.

Then we will select the important features for classification model and try the various classification models. After checking the accuracy and confusion matrix we will select the best model for this dataset.

In this project we are going to use Decision tree classifier, Random forest classifier, Gradient boosting classifier, K- nearest neighbour classifier, XGboost classifier and Support vector machine classifier with Hyperparameter tuning and cross validation techniques to obtain best result.
